# QCloud Systems — Informational Site

This repository contains the source for **info.qcloud.systems**, a lightweight
documentation and information hub built using **GitHub Pages**. The site is
designed to host technical notes, project summaries, architecture references,
and general documentation related to QCloud Systems.

## Purpose

The goal of this site is to provide a clean, minimal, and easy‑to‑maintain
location for publishing public information. It serves as a central reference
point for:

- Technical documentation  
- Project overviews  
- Architecture notes  
- Deployment references  
- General informational content  

The layout is intentionally simple and responsive, making it easy to extend as
the content grows.

## Technology Stack

This site uses:

- **GitHub Pages** for hosting  
- **Custom domain** via Cloudflare DNS  
- **Static HTML/CSS** (no build tools required)  
- **Responsive docs‑style layout**  

This keeps the deployment pipeline extremely lightweight while still providing a
professional presentation.
