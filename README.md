This repository contains the source code for **info.qcloud.systems**, a lightweight
documentation and information hub built using **GitHub Pages**. The site provides
a clean, minimal structure for publishing technical notes, project summaries,
architecture references, and general informational content.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this site is to serve as a simple, maintainable space for public
documentation. It is designed for:

- Technical write‑ups  
- Project documentation  
- Architecture notes  
- Deployment references  
- General informational content  

The layout is intentionally minimal and responsive, making it easy to extend as
the content grows.

---

## 🧰 Technology Stack

- **GitHub Pages** — static hosting  
- **DNS registrar** — custom domain configuration  
- **HTML + CSS** — no build tools required  
- **Responsive docs‑style layout**  

This keeps the deployment pipeline extremely lightweight while still providing a
professional presentation.

## 🌐 Deployment

Deployment is handled automatically by GitHub Pages:

1. Push changes to the `main` branch  
2. GitHub Pages rebuilds and deploys the site  
3. The site becomes available at **https://info.qcloud.systems**

DNS is configured at the **domain registrar** using a `CNAME` record pointing to:

<github-username>.github.io

Code

GitHub Pages automatically manages the SSL certificate once DNS is correctly configured.
